Human beings don’t design from scratch, so your AI EDA assistant shouldn’t either! Imagine if your AI could leverage your and your company’s knowledge as accumulated over the years — your organization's prior products, licensed IP, proprietary in-house designs, and even your unique coding styles. What if it could also incorporate your specific project documentation, including market requirements, system specifications, and detailed module specs?
 
This is where tools like GitHub CoPilot fail. These simply take your input prompts for processing by a general purpose AI that accesses and has been trained on publicly available, average data. Not only does this raise legal concerns surrounding data privacy, it also prevents your organization from truly differentiating itself in the marketplace.
 
PrimisAI's EDA AI assistant, Magnus, takes a very different approach. Designed with enterprise needs in mind, Magnus operates in a fully private setting. It not only excels at generating code, it also allows you to upload your data into a private knowledge base. Magnus then leverages this customized information in its responses and code generation, ensuring that your projects maintain their competitive edge.
