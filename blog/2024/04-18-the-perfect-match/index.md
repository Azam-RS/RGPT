Imagine a world where you and your trusted AI assistant (they, them, theirs) have just completed the frontend design of your latest chip. It seems like only a few hours have passed since you established the high-level product requirements, with your assistant suggesting possible architectural implementations and tradeoffs to consider. As you deliberated on the optimal  IP to use, your assistant searched its IP catalog for the best options and answered all your questions about specs and features. They then outlined the high-level data-flows in the chip and crafted the first pseudo code for the necessary control logic.

After iterating through the high-level specifications and architectural implementations, you proceeded with the design. Your assistant crafted the first RTL code and immediately executed synthesis and timing analysis to help assess the anticipated power, performance, and area.  They also coded the initial verification test bench, started simulations, and proposed changes to the design for bugs found. They even automatically added test cases to raise the verification code coverage.
 
After only a few iterations you already reached the confidence needed to warrant hand-off of the design to the backend team. Your AI assistant not only assisted with the architectural specification, IP selection, RTL coding, and verification of your latest chip but also helped you do so in a record time and with a high level of confidence your team will not be wasting time having to fix unforeseen issues or bugs while layout is in progress.
