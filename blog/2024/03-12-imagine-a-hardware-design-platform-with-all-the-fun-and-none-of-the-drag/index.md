Remembering our days as students and our early days as chip designers, we think of all the things we used to despise... like none of us ever wanted to write any comments... thought of them as simply a waste of time... because you already know what our code does. The same goes for documentation, the same goes for changing the context of a design, renaming variables, or making the code robust for cases that might happen, not relevant to our current problem that we were solving.
 
Over the years, under pressure from senior designers and managers, we reluctantly learned to add comments, add documentation, and learned the patience of making the design robust to enhance its usability by ourselves, and potentially others, but never felt great about doing such things... always prayed for a better system so that we could avoid doing those things.
Enter Gen AI... and RapidGPT!
 
We think our prayers may be finally answered. (As design engineers, we donâ€™t believe in anything too fast.)
We can clearly see a world where designers do not have to write comments, documentation, change the context of design, make a design robust, or do test benches... in fact, in our experiments, RapidGPT does this and more today... over a thousand people have tried... major corporations are testing it or using it. We have designed small ASICs based on very high specs which were written with the help of RapidGPT itself.
 
And this is just the beginning... over time, we feel designers should interact with Gen AI-based systems at a very high level, changing the specs and assessing the impact of changes on the performance of the design.
 
Stay tuned... we predict Gen AI-based chip design systems are going to totally change our perspective on how chip design is done!
