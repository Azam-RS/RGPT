# IP Catalog

:::warning Experimental Feature Notice

üõ†Ô∏è This IP Catalog feature is currently under active development. The list of IPs provided here may not be exhaustive. Users are encouraged to utilize RapidGPT's chat to request a current list of available IPs or ask for specific IP details. We appreciate your understanding as we work to enhance and expand this feature.

This embedded documentation feature in RapidGPT's chat assistant enhances the user experience by providing easy access to vital information, thereby assisting in informed decision-making and efficient use of the IP Catalog.

## Practical Example: Data Acquisition Module Using Xilinx IPs

In FPGA designs, integrating memory elements and CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) structures is crucial. Xilinx Parameterized Macros (XPMs) offer a versatile way to add these components to projects, enhancing efficiency and customizability. This example demonstrates the use of Xilinx BRAM (Block Random Access Memory) and CDC macros in a data acquisition module to efficiently transfer and store sensor data across different clock domains.

### Utilizing RapidGPT for IP Integration

RapidGPT aids in the seamless instantiation of Xilinx macros and IP cores. Below is an example prompt that illustrates the process of designing and integrating XPMs into RTL designs.
