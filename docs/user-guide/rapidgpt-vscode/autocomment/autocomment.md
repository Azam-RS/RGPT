- **Seamless integration:** Works smoothly within the RapidGPT environment.

**Benefits:**
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Reduced time spent on manual documentation
- Streamlined review and approval process

## Get Started with AutoComment

For detailed annotations on a single Verilog file, follow these steps:

### 1. Open a Verilog File
Open a verilog file in VS-Code. For this tutorial, we'll be opening the file "**ram.v**" as created **[Your First Project](/docs/tutorials/your-first-project/your-first-project.md)** tutorial



### 2. Open Command Palette in VS Code:
1. Open the Command Palette with **Cmd+Shift+P** (MacOS) or **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Windows/Linux), then select '**RapidGPT: AutoComment**' to activate the feature, initiating the combined process of syntax checking and automatic error correction. 
2. Alternatively, below the RapidGPT chatbox window, click on "**COMMANDS**" and select "**AutoComment**" from the dropdown menu to use the feature.
