# Pro Plan Setting

When selecting the Pro Plan subscription, users will be prompted to choose a payment plan. Users can select either monthly or annual billing frequency.

After selecting the preferred billing frequency, users must check the checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions before proceeding to payment by clicking "Continue to Payment."

Users will then be directed to a third-party payment gateway (Stripe) to complete the transaction.

After successful payment verification, users will receive a welcome email containing subscription details, and an API Key will be issued.

Users can copy this API Key and integrate it into their VS Code extension settings. Once configured, users are ready to use RapidGPT with all its advanced features.
