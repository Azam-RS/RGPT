# Managing Subscriptions

This page displays a comprehensive list of all user subscriptions, showcasing essential details such as the subscription name, payment frequency, renewal date, issue date, allocated seats, current status, and access to receipts. Users can access further details by clicking on a subscription, providing an in-depth understanding of each subscription.

Additionally, users can conveniently access their invoices directly from the subscription page by clicking on the billing link.

## View Subscription

Click on a subscription to view its details. Subscriptions initially begin with a trial period and transition to an Active status once the trial period concludes. During the trial, users cannot modify seat settings or billing frequency. However, once the trial is complete, both payment and seat settings become editable.

An edit icon is located at the top right, enabling users to modify subscription details as needed.

## Domain Level Access

For Team Pro subscribers, there is a feature that allows onboarding team members without sending individual invitations. The Admin can enable domain-level access by clicking the "Domain Level Access" checkbox and entering the company's domain name.

Users with email addresses associated with the specified domain will automatically receive an API key. Upon subscription, users will receive an invitation email containing the company name. By clicking the button in the email, users will be directed to the login page of the RapidGPT website.

First-time users need to sign up by providing the necessary credentials. After signing up, log in to the RapidGPT portal. Upon successful login, users will find the invitation on their dashboard. Choose to accept the invitation to receive the API key for immediate access.

## Seat Settings

Users can adjust the number of seats using the plus and minus buttons. Each change recalculates and displays the subscription amount. If all seats are occupied and the user wants to decrease the count, a notification will prompt them to revoke licenses from the members page first. The seat count can be reduced down to a minimum of 4 seats.

## Billing Frequency

Users can choose between monthly or annual billing cycles. Selecting an annual subscription offers a 15% discount.

## Billing

On the billing page, users can view detailed information about all their invoices, including the invoice ID, date, payment date, amount, and status. Users also have the option to view and download invoices by clicking the download icon. Note that the Stripe link for downloading invoices expires after 30 days.

## Cancel Subscription

To cancel your subscription, select the "Cancel Subscription" option located next to the "Update/Payment" button on the Edit Plan page. This action will immediately terminate your subscription. However, any active API keys will remain functional until the renewal date, at which point they will no longer operate. Subscription benefits, including access to Auto Comment, Auto Doc, Auto Review, and the IP Catalog, will continue until the end of the current billing cycle.
