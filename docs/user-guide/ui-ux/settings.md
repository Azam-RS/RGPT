# Settings

## API Key

The API key setting is used to securely authenticate and authorize access to our API. Create an account on 
[RapidGPT's website](https://getrapidgpt.primis.ai/) and copy-paste [your RapidGPT API key](https://getrapidgpt.primis.ai/Home/AccountInformation) in this field.

## Precision

Adjusts the AI's precision to suit different preferences. The mood setting ranges from "More Precise" for accuracy-focused outputs, to "Balanced" (the default) for a well-rounded approach, and to "More Creative" for outputs that prioritize creativity and innovation.

## Interactivity Rate

This setting controls how much RapidGPT engages with you in response to your prompts. A higher interactivity rate means that the AI will ask more follow-up questions and provide more detailed responses. A lower interactivity rate means that the AI will be more concise and direct in its responses.

## Custom API Endpoint

By configuring the Custom API Endpoint setting, you can specify the URL path and HTTP method for an alternative endpoint. This allows you to define your own API route that corresponds to a specific RapidGPT resource within your organization.

## Chat History Path

Specify an optional path to save the chat history. By default, RapidGPT manages the chat history project-wise. However, using this option allows you to override the default behavior and save the chat history to a specific location. Please note that enabling this option will supersede the project-wise chat history management.

## Debug Code

If this code is provided, experimental features will be activated. Empty by default.
