# Your First Project

In this tutorial, we will go through the process of creating a simple project using RapidGPT with persistent chat history.

:::note

Please note that RapidGPT has the [incognito mode](../user-guide/interactive-chat/incognito) enabled by default when no active workspace is open in VS Code and when no Verilog file is open in the main editor. As a result, chat history is only saved when a Verilog file is created in the active workspace.

:::

## Step 1: Create a New Project
1. Open VS Code.
2. Click on "File" in the top menu and select "Open Folder".
3. Choose a location (or create a new one) on your computer where you want to create the project folder and click "Select Folder".
4. The project folder will open in the VS Code workspace.

## Step 2: Initialize RapidGPT
1. In the VS Code sidebar, click on the RapidGPT icon to open the RapidGPT panel.
2. The chat panel will appear on one of the sides of the VS Code window (by default, on the left).
3. Start a conversation with RapidGPT by typing a message in the chat input box.
4. RapidGPT will respond with suggestions or code snippets based on your input.

## Step 3: Persistent Chat History
1. To automatically save the chat history, create a Verilog file in the current project.
2. Right-click on the project folder in the VS Code sidebar and select "New File".
3. Enter a name for the Verilog file, including the ".v" extension (e.g., "example.v").
4. Open the newly created Verilog file.
5. The chat history will now be automatically saved with each interaction.


# Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you have learned how to create a project using RapidGPT. Remember that the chat history is only saved when a Verilog file is created in the current project. Use the chat panel to interact with RapidGPT, receive code suggestions, and optimize your design. Enjoy the power of RapidGPT and streamline your hardware design process like never before!
