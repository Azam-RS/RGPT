# Action Buttons

When HDL code is included in a RapidGPT response, it will be displayed within a nicely formatted code snippet area. This area is especially helpful as it offers three action buttons that facilitate interaction between the main editor, the chat panel, and the user.

## Save as New File
By pressing the `Save as new file` button, RapidGPT will prompt the user to choose a destination location and filename for saving the file.

## Copy to Clipboard
This action button allows you to conveniently select and copy the entire code within a code snippet area to the clipboard. This feature is especially useful when you need to quickly copy and paste code generated by RapidGPT into external third-party software, facilitating its integration.

## Merge Code

To take full advantage of this feature, we recommend using it within a [module chat scope](scopes).

To make code merging and review easier, RapidGPT offers a convenient merge code shortcut. When you activate this shortcut, a side-by-side diff comparison screen will open, showing both the original module and the updated version. This interface is similar to the ones used by developers on platforms like GitHub.
