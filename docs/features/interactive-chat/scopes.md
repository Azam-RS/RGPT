# Conversation Scopes

Conversation scopes are a convenient way to interact with different modules in the RapidGPT chat interface. Located at below the chat panel, it displays the names of the various modules defined in the selected Verilog file. By clicking on a module name, the chat context switches, allowing you to engage exclusively with the chatbot for that specific module without any additional specifications.

To access a desired module, simply select its name (e.g., "fulladder"). You can then interact with RapidGPT to improve and modify the implementation through follow-up requests. This includes adding signals, enhancing functionality, and more. Enjoy the seamless experience of interacting with specific modules!
