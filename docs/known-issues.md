# Known Issues

While using RapidGPT, it's important to be aware of the following limitations and known issues.

## Response Delay
At times, responses from RapidGPT may experience long delays, exceeding 20 seconds. This delay occurs when the underlying AI model is overloaded. Patience is advised during such periods.

## Iterative Approach
The initially generated code may not fully comply with the specifications. Users should interact with RapidGPT, providing feedback and clarifying the issues. This enables RapidGPT to iteratively refine the code until it aligns with all specifications.

## Response Generation
There might be instances when RapidGPT fails to generate a response. In such cases, users should delete their last message and resend it to prompt a response from RapidGPT.

## Code Syntax/Readability
Occasionally, RapidGPT may generate code with formatting or readability issues. If this occurs, deleting the code response and its corresponding question will allow RapidGPT to generate a new, improved code response.

By keeping these limitations and known issues in mind, users can better navigate their interactions with RapidGPT and effectively address any challenges that may arise.
